# Although the Celery handles amqps using Kombu Python module,
# it does not do that correctly.
#
# When using "amqps://" protocol, Kombu uses SSLTransport which effectively
# sets the `amqp.Connection.ssl = True`. This enables SSL, but it does it
# in a way when we cannot set any other SSL options like client cert/key
# or for example SNI hostname which needs to be used.
#
# This is done in this commit:
# In the https://github.com/celery/kombu/commit/701672c2ba732883869a42f061a10dbfc8fe2f30
#
# To workaround this, we detect "amqps" here and sets the `broker_use_ssl`. This
# allows us to set any SSL options like client cert/key or SNI header.
# The `broker_use_ssl` is directly passed to `amqp.Connection.ssl` which handles
# it.
#
# In the end, we change the `broker_url` protocol from "amqps" to "amqp", so
# the Celery wont' override the `amps.Connection.ssl` with `True`.
